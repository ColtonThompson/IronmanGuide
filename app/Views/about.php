            </br>Thank you to Oziris for creating this guide in the first place, without this content this webpage would not exist, and many IronMan accounts would be gimps. You can support Oziris by sending a tip/donation his way: <a href="paypal.me/ozirisrs" target="_blank">paypal.me/ozirisrs</a>

            </br>I created this website version of the guide with the sole purpose of following Oziris' guide myself but didn't like trying to read the text that was disorganized and against a plain white background.
            </br></br>
            I developed this website over the course of a single weekend with the expectation that maybe a few friends and myself would use it but now it has been viewed over <b>100,000</b> times since it was created.
            </br></br>
            The ads on the site go towards the time and effort into creating this version of the guide, so I would appreciate those who disable adblock!
            </br></br>
            Thank you for using this guide! Goodluck scaping!
