        <h3>Assumptions</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>This guide assumes that you always carry your cash stack, unless I say not to bring it. I will mention to bring gp regardless most of the time, but if I don't then keep it on you anyway.</li>
            <li>Use every book and lamp on Herblore if possible.</li>
            <li>Use Authenticator AND 2-step verification on registered e-mail</li>
        </ul>
