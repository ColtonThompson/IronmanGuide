### What is this? When was it created?
This project was started in May 2017. I was an active player of Oldschool RuneScape during this time and I was playing as an Ironman which is a more difficult playstyle for the game and many guides have been written for it. I was following a guide from a person named Oziris which he wrote this guide in pastebin as raw text. I found it somewhat painful to read and follow so I decided to create a website version to make it easier to follow and easier to read. 

### Why did I select this item? What specific components does this artifact showcase of my skills and abilities in software development? How was it improved?
This item demonstrates my ability to come up with a creative solution to a problem using programming. The inital version of this website was a poor attempt, however I decided after 3-4 months of this project being live for others to use (with significant traffic) that it deserved a rewrite. I rewrote the project using CodeIgniter (which is a high level PHP framework) and developed new features and improved upon the original design to add quality of life for the user.

### Challenges and Reflection
The challenge of this project was initially my knowledge of PHP and understanding how websites operate. The hardest feature to add was saving a person's progress through the guide using checkboxes because there is about 30 pages with over 10-30 steps per page that need individual tracking. With some research and development I managed to solve this problem with around 15 lines of code or less. This project initially was just for me and was never really intended to be for others to use, but after a few weeks because I had planned on using SEO friendly URLs it blew up and now receives (at the time of this writing) 50k unique visits a month and is showing signs of growth still.
